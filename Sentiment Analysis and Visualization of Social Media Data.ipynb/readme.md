# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used includes tweets classified into different sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The model uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis and Logistic Regression for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) and contains two CSV files:

- `twitter_training.csv`: The training dataset containing labeled tweets.
- `twitter_validation.csv`: The validation dataset for testing the model's performance.

### Columns

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- **Topic**: The topic associated with the tweet.
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment label (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Text**: The content of the tweet.

## Installation

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn wordcloud
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) and place the CSV files in the `data` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab notebook and run the code cells to analyze the sentiment of the tweets.

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the datasets, check for missing values, and clean the data.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use VADER to obtain sentiment scores for each tweet and classify them into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

3. **Visualization**: Create various visualizations, including:
   - Pie charts showing sentiment distribution.
   - Count plots comparing actual vs. predicted sentiments.
   - Word clouds for Positive and Negative tweets.
   - Box plots for tweet length by sentiment.

4. **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF vectorization of tweet texts.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Use the validation dataset to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, including a confusion matrix and classification report.

## Results

The project outputs various visualizations and metrics that provide insights into the sentiment of tweets and the performance of the sentiment analysis model.

### Metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
