## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Amazon sales data to uncover trends, identify sales performance across different categories, and provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory and marketing strategies. The goal is to leverage data analytics to enhance business decisions and improve overall sales performance.

## Problem Statement
To analyze Amazon sales data to uncover trends, identify sales performance across different categories, and provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory and marketing strategies.

## Project Roadmap
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather sales data from Amazon, focusing on key metrics like sales volume, revenue, and product categories.
   
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct EDA to understand the dataset, including visualizations of sales trends over time and category performance.
   
4. **Data Modeling:**
   - Use statistical methods to identify patterns and correlations within the data.
   
5. **Insights Generation:**
   - Derive actionable insights based on the analysis.
   
6. **Reporting:**
   - Present findings through visualizations and summaries.

## Dataset
- **Amazon Sales Dataset** (including features such as order date, product category, sales amount, and quantity sold).

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handled missing values and duplicates using the Pandas library.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Conducted correlation analysis and trend identification to assess sales performance.
    
## Modules Used
1. **Pandas:**
   - **Purpose:** Data manipulation and analysis.
   - **Functionality:** Facilitates data cleaning, exploration, and transformation.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
   data.dropna(inplace=True)
   ```

2. **NumPy:**
   - **Purpose:** Numerical operations and handling arrays.
   - **Functionality:** Supports advanced mathematical functions.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   total_customers = np.sum(data['customer_id'])
   ```

3. **Matplotlib:**
   - **Purpose:** Data visualization.
   - **Functionality:** Creates static and interactive visualizations.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.hist(data['age'], bins=30)
   plt.title('Age Distribution of Customers')
   plt.xlabel('Age')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency')
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Seaborn:**
   - **Purpose:** Statistical data visualization.
   - **Functionality:** Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   sns.countplot(x='purchase', data=data)
   plt.title('Purchase Distribution')
   plt.show()
   ```

5. **Scikit-Learn:**
   - **Purpose:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
   - **Functionality:** Provides tools for classification, regression, and model evaluation.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
   model = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini')
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

## Insights
- The Gini criterion provided a slightly higher accuracy compared to the Entropy criterion in classifying customer purchases.
- The confusion matrix and classification reports highlighted the model's strengths and weaknesses in predicting purchases.

## Impact
- Improved understanding of customer behavior, enabling better-targeted marketing strategies.
- Actionable insights derived from model predictions can lead to increased conversion rates and enhanced customer engagement.

## Installation
To install the necessary modules, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To run the analysis, clone the repository and execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
jupyter notebook
```
